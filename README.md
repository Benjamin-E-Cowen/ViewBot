# ViewBot
Created for strictly "educational purposes". ViewBot serves to create seamlessly organic Internet Traffic. It leverages the Tor network to effectively generate source IP addresses from all over the globe, and has a series of functions that randomize behavior. It was built primarily for youtube to generate views, but has many applications otherwise.
